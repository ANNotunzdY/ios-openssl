This script builds OpenSSL 1.0.0a for iOS.

It builds multi-architecture libaries with armv6, armv7 and i386.

This script is known to work with the following combination of software versions:

 * MacOS X 10.6.4
 * XCode 3.2.4 & iOS SDK 4.1

Building is done by invoking the build.sh script:

 ./build.sh

It will take about 5 minutes on a modern Mac. The result of the build can be found at:

 lib/ - will contain libssl.a and libcrypto.a
 include/ - will contain all OpenSSL headers

If you just want cryptographic functions then you can skip libssl.a and just add
libcrypto.a to your project.

Making your code find the OpenSSL headers works best if the path to the include director is
added to the 'Header Search Paths' in your target settings.

The Example directory contains a little sample app. It calculates a SHA1 digest using
the OpenSSL API.

Enjoy.
